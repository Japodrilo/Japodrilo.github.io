      "summary": "We unify two popular graph classes, strongly chordal graphs and chordal bigraphs, by introducing an umbrella class that contains both classes and maintains their essential properties. This is done by allowing loops at vertices. Considering loops often has little impact on a class of graphs; it however makes a big difference in this case. We give ordering characterizations, matrix characterizations, and forbidden subgraph characterizations of the new class, and illustrate its usefulness by solving the minimum domination problem in this general context. This implies solutions of both the minimum dominating set in strongly chordal graphs and the minimum total dominating set in chordal bigraphs."
